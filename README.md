AutoShelf is an unofficial app designed to work alongside [Dropshelf](https://pilotmoon.com/dropshelf).

AutoShelf monitors a folder (by default user's downloads) for new files, and instantly creates a shelf to display the newly added file. After 30 seconds (the time can be adjusted in the settings), the shelf closes automatically.

> [!NOTE]
>AutoShelf requires Dropshelf installed and running to function.
